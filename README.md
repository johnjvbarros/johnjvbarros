Here are some rand(facts) about me:

- 🤔 Learning new things is a hobby for me, and I have found myself now in love with Software Development (JS > React > ...)
- 📈 I love working with Excel, and through it I found myself going down the rabbit hole to coding (mostly RPA projects).
- 🎹 I taught myself to play the acoustic guitar, ukulele, piano and banjo.
- 🌐 I speak English and Portuguese fluently, but also studied French for 3 years (Oui je n'ai pas oublie completment comment écrire et parler).
- 🎓 I graduated in Electrical Engineering, but have been working with IT and Sales and I love it!
- 🍴 I love cooking, learning new recipes and eating. Having meals with people is my love language.
